Microeconomics: This course introduces students to the way in which a free market economic system resolves the basic social questions of what goods and services to produce, how scarce resources are organized to produce these goods, and to whom the goods are distributed once they are produced. Students explore the components of the market system, supply and demand, and how they interact under conditions ranging from perfect competition to monopoly. Students determine the prices for resources within a society and understand the efficient wage rate for workers. The course concludes with a look at government intervention and the creation of public goods. Macroeconomics: The purpose of the course is to expose students to the economic way of thinking by looking at how the economy works on a macro, or large scale. After a brief introduction to the basic economic principles, students examine theories which explain the economic behavior of different economic agents, including the behavior of financial and monetary systems. Using simple models, we will look into determination of aggregate, economy-wide variables such as overall output, unemployment, and inflation. The course concludes with a unit on international trade and currency, and their impact on aggregate variables.

The course is an elective for Junior and Senior students. The course is designed to give students a critical perspective on government and politics in the United States through examination of the fundamental ideological and philosophical traditions and ideas underlying the democratic government established by the constitution, and their role in that government. In the first half of the course, students will focus on specific portions of American Government in preparation for the AP U.S. Government and Politics exam, including constitutional underpinnings of American Government; political beliefs and behaviors; political parties, interest groups, the mass media; the institutions of American Government, specifically government agencies and the bureaucracy; public policy; and civil rights and civil liberties. The second half of the course will be devoted to the comparison of different government forms in preparation for the Comparative Government and Politics exam, and attempting to determine why so many varieties of governments exist, and where the United States fits into global politics. We will specifically use Great Britain from the Industrialized World; Russia and China from the Developing World; and Mexico, Iran, and Nigeria from the Third World; as model case studies, but will not be limited just to these nations. After an introduction to the study of Comparative Politics, the class will move into discussing sovereignty, authority, and power; political institutions and public policy from a comparative standpoint; citizens, society, and the state; and political and economic change. One of the primary goals of the course is to increase understanding of the political traditions, values, and structures of political systems. The work involved concerns the study of political science theory and methodology, and its application to the analysis of specific countries. At the end of the year, students will engage in discussions of the History of Democratization, American Political Thought, American Foreign Policy in the 20th century through today, and the role of International Organizations in the world today. The course is a college level course and is taught as such. It is lecture based and is both reading and writing intensive. It is a fast-paced course and much outside work and preparation is required to be successful. The overall purpose of this course is to specifically prepare students who wish to study a field of the Social Sciences in college, and to generally serve as a strong foundation for all those seeking a college education. To that end, students enrolled in this course should be aware that they will encounter extensive primary and secondary reading in the class, and that it is absolutely essential they read and understand all material given to them throughout the year. Students will be given outside readings from contemporary sources (such as major newspapers, journals, and magazines), as well as speeches and policy statements, and will be expected to follow national and international politics and events during the course of the school year. Even for students who may not wish to study Government and Politics in college, these areas impact everyone, from the fields of science, medicine, and engineering, to business, education, and international relations. This course will better help students navigate the legal procedures and regulations relating to a variety of fields, as well as the impact that government has on our everyday lives. Students choosing Honors level and Advanced Placement courses should be aware of required summer readings and preparation for each course. All advanced courses will require summer preparation previous to the first day of school. Failure to complete required summer preparation will significantly affect the student’s first nine-week grade during the following academic year.

        ('leadership studies 1', 'social studies',	'leadership,organizational skills,community engagement,self-reflection', 'What is leadership? The definition of the term is often as varied as those with whom we associate as leaders. And what is the nature, or basis, of leadership? Is leadership merely the study of those individuals who take charge of situations around them for their own selfish benefit, or do these individuals act for a greater societal good? And what makes a good leader? Are leadership skills transferable between disciplines? Are there certain “universal” leadership techniques that can be learned, or are there truly some individuals who really are “destined” to lead? This class is designed to both answer these questions, as well as empower the next generation of leaders in our society. In the 21st century, leadership skills are more valuable than ever, and will allow students to thrive in our diverse and ever-changing world. Regardless of a student’s chosen path in life, they will constantly be called upon to show leadership. The goal of this class is to help place them on the path to quality leadership in a variety of settings. One of the strengths for this class is that it is very personal and applicable to a student’s development and everyday life, not to mention their future. This class is meant to be active and engaging, if not exciting. Skills students will learn in this class will prove extremely valuable to them both now and in the future, and students could make this course the most important class they take in their entire high school career. The class will be broken up into two main sections. The first will be the theories and concepts of leadership. As such, we will study leadership from a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints, utilizing historical texts and contemporary examples, with the goal of identifying important attributes of leadership. As students will learn in this course, there is a difference between “leaders” and “leadership,” and in addition to studying examples of leaders, we will also be looking at leadership as a process, as well. As such, we will utilize different approaches, such as the Relational Leadership Model, to analyze effective leadership. Readings and class discussion will incorporate leadership philosophies, ideas, and examples and will have the goal of helping students see leadership traits, qualities and properties shared by all great leaders as well as how they can improve the leadership process in their own life. The course has four major units of instruction: an introduction to leadership, leadership on the personal level, leadership on the organizational level, and ethics. Within these four broad areas, we will examine specific elements, such as vision and goal setting, identifying and overcoming obstacles, power and influence, followership, Level 5 Leadership, innovation and creativity, emotional intelligence, kaizen, confident and efficacy of leadership, personality and other variables that influence leadership, organizational culture and change, individual strengths and positive psychology, and integrity and values. Students will also learn about the historical growth of the field of Leadership Studies, as well as specific models of leadership, such as situational and transformational leadership. Students will then have the opportunity to apply lessons to fields such as athletics, business, government and politics, and the military. The second component of the class will be practical in nature. Students in the class will be expected to participate in community service activities in fields of their choosing. Students will also be expected to join either a school-based or community group of their choosing and actively participate in it by designing and implementing an activity of their choice, and overseeing it to its conclusion. This capstone project will be a culmination of a student’s work in the class, and will allow the students to apply the leadership skills they have studied and learned by supervising a real-world project. Assessments in the class will be a combination of class participation, journal entries, article reflections, book reviews, movie reviews, and written and oral biographies of leaders. The primary assessment mode used will be reflections, where in each unit students analyze their leadership skills and determine ways they can improve them. Students should be aware that assessment in the class is entirely written in nature and the class requires students to have sufficient motivation and dedication to commit themselves to completing all class assignments. This class welcomes all students who desire to learn about and become better leaders and approach the course and its content with an open mind. In short, leadership is said to be that magical elixir of excellence, quality results, productivity, and performance. It is the hot topic and emphasized item as perhaps the most important skill one can possess today. It is the goal of this course to give students both a firm grounding of the theory and history of leadership, as well as provide them with a self-designed “leadership template” they can apply in a practical opportunity to grow and recognize the leaders they already are, and can become. As the first part of the two-semester leadership curriculum sequence at the high school, this course links with Leadership Studies II and it is hoped that students would eventually take both courses if possible to maximize their leadership knowledge.', 190, 0.5, '9,10,11,12', 'semester', None),

In Leadership Studies I, students learned different definitions and theories of leadership, about themselves as leaders, how to better lead within organizations, and ethical leadership. This class will provide a more in-depth study of leadership as well as give students more tools by which they can be effective leaders. Topics that cannot be adequately discussed in Leadership Studies I will be covered and skills that were introduced in Leadership Studies I will be further built upon. Within this course, several national models of leadership excellence, including the Kouzes & Posner Student Leadership Challenge, Covey’s Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens, Servant-Leadership, and the Leadership and Social Change Model will be utilized to further enhance the leadership capabilities of students. Students in this course will also learn about Project Management as well as Negotiations and Conflict Resolution. As in Leadership Studies I, students will be expected to perform community service while enrolled in the course, to keep a journal documenting their experiences, to write reflection essays on the major units of instruction, and also to participate in a capstone leadership project to demonstrate leadership skills. This course has been approved as the equivalent of LDRSHP 1100/ PUBSRV 1390: Theories of Leadership at the University of Pittsburgh. Thus, this course is designed to acquaint students with multiple theories and practices associated with effective leadership. In answering the question, “what is leadership”, it examines such theories as situational, participative, transformational, and servant leadership. It also addresses those leadership and administrative skills and practices usually associated with effective community organization and professional management. Students will also have the option of earning three (3) college credits through the University of Pittsburgh for this course. This course also is the first class in the sequence for the undergraduate Leadership Certificate the University of Pittsburgh offers. Additionally, students who complete the two-leadership course sequence at the high school will have completed the requirements for the National Student Council Distinguished Student Leaders Program, administered by the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) and can also apply for recognition by this program as well. Students who complete this course should be well-equipped, along with what they learned in Leadership Studies I, to be more effective leaders as well as be prepared to enter into Leadership Development programs at the college level, and also have the necessary knowledge to effect positive change in their community and own life as well.

Beyond individuals, we will discuss positive organizations and communities. Additional topics include character strengths, compassion, fulfillment, hope, optimism, mindfulness, mind-body wellness, gratitude, flow, satisficing, self-efficacy and motivation, grit, and resilience.
